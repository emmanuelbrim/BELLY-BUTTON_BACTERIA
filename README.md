# BELLY-BUTTON_BACTERIA
Rosza a researcher in a biological laboratory is helping Improbable Beef find a bacteria that synthesizes protein and taste like beef. This bacteria she belives is in the naval of humans. In order to present the data to her volunteers and other researchers she has prepared a dashboard using Plotly.

This project was to help her complete the visualization effort by creating charts for the top 10 bacteria in the belly buttons of volunteers. The dashboard presents users with the opportunity to select an ID of a candidate to produce three charts (bar, bubble and gauge) from the top 10 bacteria found.
